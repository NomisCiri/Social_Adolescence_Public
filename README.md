# Hi
NOTE: DUE TO DATA PROTECTION REASON WE CAN NOT PUBLICLY PROVIDE RAW DATA FOR THE EXPERMENTS.

This is a new repository that leads you through the Social Adolescent project.
This is supposed to enable anyone to reproduce all the steps and analyis of the project.
The steps so far are labelled from A through D.

In each file there are README's that will be shown automatically.
These will show you the resluts and some code of the latest analysis.

This repository does not contain the stan Data files that are created in the process because they are just too big.
If you want to plug and play you need R/3.5.1 and stan installed. A PBS Cluster would be good too.

Now each folder should be a self contained project folder that has everything you need to simulate data, make the model comparison, fit the models for Braams and Blankenstein and examine the model fits.
