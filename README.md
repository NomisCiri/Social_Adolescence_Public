# Hi

This is a new Repository that leads you through the OCU Data. It is still in the making but in principle
this is supposed to enable anyone to reproduce all the steps and analyisi of the project.
The steps so far are labelled from A through D.

In each File there are READMEs that will be shown automatically.
These will show you the resluts of the latest analysis.

This Repository does not contain the stan Data files that are created in the process because they are just too big.


Now this should be a self contained Project Folder that has everything you need to Simulate
Data, make the Model Comaprison, fit the Models for Braams and Blankenstein and examine the 
Model Fits.

# Agenda:

* Parameter and Recovery for New Models, finally.
* Blankenstein Dataset Model Fits is better when we assume age wise distributions
* Braams Dataset Model Fits is better when we assume age wise distributions
  * Do i add this in my Model Comparison?
* What do the Parameter Correlations mean?
* I Work in Advisor Utility Function for Both Datasets as we discussed last time
* What kind of Parameter Inference do I report? Do i make inference Statistics? In a table? Where do i emphazize how my modelling made
the data look more coherent?

# To Dos

* Dig into BrainData with Doug# OCU_Public
